- We are building for GNUstep on FreeBSD, not Darwin.
- Use commands from `$PATH`, not hardcoded paths.
- Use `gmake`, not `make`.
- Avoid bashisms; use POSIX sh.
- Build the application until it works, even with multiple attempts.
- Fix all compiler warnings, regardless of severity.
- Use `sudo -A` for commands requiring root privileges.
- Compile with `clang19`, never `gcc`.
- Use extensive logging for debugging with NSLog. Put detailed logging in all methods
- If you build a preference pane, test with `/System/Applications/SystemPreferences.app/SystemPreferences`.
- Refer to FreeBSD documentation and the porters handbook for building ports.
- Before running any shell commands, check which shell is being used.
- Remember that in one Terminal, you can only run one command at a time unless you use `&` to run it in the background.
- Always run commands with `timeout` to prevent hanging.
- If you run the same command multiple times, write an action to run it instead of repeating the command.
- We don't have `strace`, so use `truss` for tracing system calls.
- Dispatch functions are not available in GNUstep.
- Do NOT use Auto Layout, as it is not supported in GNUstep. Use explicit frame layouts instead.
- Put code logically in multiple files, not in one large file. Make (simple) classes for reusability, for things we might need elsewhere again.
- Use Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture where appropriate.
- Always use a `GNUmakefile` to compile anything involving Foundation or GNUstep.
- Never "create a simple test to verify" anything. Verify using /System/Applications/LoginWindow.app or other system applications.
